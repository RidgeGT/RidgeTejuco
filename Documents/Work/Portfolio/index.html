                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Ridge. I'm a junior software developer currently looking for back-end development roles.</p>
                <p> 
                    
                    I am most interested in back-end functionality, managing and integrating databases, Computer Networking, and data analysis.
                    I studied Computer Engineering at CSUN, where I also designed, prototyped, and tested electronics using Pspice, OrCad, and breadboarding. 
                    I am proficient with VHDL, Verilog, and SystemVerilog for design of digital systems and FPGA circuits. I love everything about computers both software and hardware.

        <div id = "aboutme2" class = "row aboutMe-section" >
            <div class = "abTxt col">
                <p> I was born in Los Angeles and raised in Granada Hills, CA. Growing up I've always had a deep fascination with electronics, computers, 
                    calculators and how their internals worked. In middle school I programmed small animations and webpages. I loved playing video games and wanted to make my own. 
                    In highschool, I wondered how mice could detect motion with their sensors and send that signal to the PC to produce motion on the monitor. I was interested in how calculators peform basic operations such as addition,
                    and multiplication, how it could understand numbers and store information. I wondered how the software that I used all the time such as Word and Excel were developed. I was frustrated that I was growing up in a world where I use technology every day, but did not know how it was made,
                    or how it worked inside. I wanted to be able to design and build my own projects. I wanted to understand modern computers from top to bottom.
